# API Reference

## Response shape

Successful mock endpoints return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request completed",
  "data": {}
}
```

The Vite development server proxies `/api` to the Express server on port 4000.

## Book catalog and overview

All `/api/v1/catalog` routes require a valid Bearer JWT. Catalog reads allow Admin, Librarian, Student, and Faculty accounts.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/catalog/categories` | Exact category IDs and names currently managed by library administrators. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/catalog/books` | Paginated live book catalog with physical-copy stock counts. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/catalog/books/:titleId` | Complete metadata and current stock overview for one active book title. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/catalog/books/:titleId/reservations` | Submit a Student or Faculty wait-list request through the circulation compatibility bridge. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/catalog/research` | Search active view-only research by title, authors, adviser, department, and year. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/catalog/research/:titleId` | Complete read-only research metadata, shelf access, and abstract. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/books/add-bulk` | Admin/Librarian-only transactional multi-copy registration; returns one QR image and Code 128 label image per accessioned copy. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/catalog/bulk-entry` | Canonical Admin/Librarian bulk-entry contract used by the database-driven catalog modal; preserves the older `/admin/books/add-bulk` alias. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/catalog/titles/:titleId/category` | Admin-only title reassignment. Requires `targetCategoryId` and `expectedRowVersion`; atomically moves the active book copies or linked research inventory to the target category's managed shelf and records an audit event. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/books/assets/:id` | Admin/Librarian-only physical-copy metadata with QR and barcode image data. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/books/assets/:id/barcode.png` | Download one high-density Code 128 PNG attachment. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/books/assets/:id/qr.png` | Download one high-density QR PNG attachment. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/catalog/copies/:barcode` | Authenticated barcode-only copy inspection for cart/catalog views; deliberately omits QR data. |

Research routes expose no mutation, borrowing, reservation, or cart endpoint. Their response metadata and every record explicitly return `viewOnly: true`.

Asset visibility is also enforced at the query and response boundaries. Administrative asset routes select and serialize `physical_copies.qr_code_data`; the catalog copy route does neither. A Student or Faculty token receives a barcode image, title, author, accession, and shelf only, while attempts to use the administrative QR routes return `403`.

The list endpoint accepts any combination of `q`, `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `category_id`, `category_name`, `publication_year`, `page`, and `limit`. Query values are bound as prepared-statement parameters. Each item includes `totalCopiesCount`, `availableCopiesCount`, `currentAvailabilityStatus`, and its preferred active shelf location, calculated from `physical_copies` rather than cached UI state.

## Database integration rule

Keep endpoint paths and response objects stable while replacing the mock arrays with repository calls. Mutating endpoints must later add server-side validation, authorization, database transactions, and audit records before they are used with real school data.

## Catalog validation and physical-copy safeguards

Book and thesis creation require an authenticated CSRF token and Librarian or System Administrator role. Thesis metadata validates Title, one or more Authors, Adviser, Year Published, Abstract, Research Code, and Department/Program before beginning the insert transaction.

Physical-copy archive/delete routes lock the `physical_copies` row and matching `borrow_transactions` rows with `FOR UPDATE`. A `Borrowed` or `Overdue` transaction returns:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "code": "PHYSICAL_COPY_HAS_ACTIVE_LOAN",
  "message": "Cannot delete copy ACC-00042 because it is currently overdue. Process its return before trying again.",
  "details": {
    "physicalCopyId": 7,
    "materialId": 42,
    "transactionId": 1047,
    "transactionStatus": "Overdue"
  }
}
```

The response status is `422 Unprocessable Entity`. A copy with completed borrowing history may be archived but cannot be hard-deleted.
# Cross-portal circulation (JWT)

| Method | Endpoint | Roles | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/reservations/request` | Student, Faculty | Join a book-title waiting queue. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/reservations` | Student, Faculty | Read the authenticated user's reservation records. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/reservations/:reservationId/cancel` | Student, Faculty | Cancel an owned waiting request and realign the queue. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/borrowing/history` | Student, Faculty | Read personal capacity and borrowing history. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/borrow/submit-request` | Student, Faculty | Atomically assign available copies and create a grouped pending-claim request from `title_ids`. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/reservations` | Admin, Librarian | Read the contextual reservation queue. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/borrowing/confirm-checkout` | Admin, Librarian | Confirm a barcode checkout. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/borrowing/monitor` | Admin, Librarian | Read active, due, overdue, and returned records. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/admin/borrowing/:transactionId/return` | Admin, Librarian | Complete a return and advance the queue. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/borrowing/:transactionId/calculate-penalty` | Admin, Librarian | Persist the current overdue calculation. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/notifications` | Admin, Librarian | Read shared circulation/reservation alerts. |
### POST `/api/v1/circulation/fulfill-claim`

Admin/Librarian-only physical desk checkpoint. Accepts `{ "school_id": "...", "barcode": "..." }`. The selected borrower and barcode must match a linked `Pending` claim whose reservation is `ready_for_pickup`. On success the loan becomes `Borrowed`, the reservation becomes `claimed`, and the due time is fixed to 8:59 AM on the next operating day.

## Admin attendance and active users (JWT)

| Method | Endpoint | Roles | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/academic-terms` | Admin, Librarian | List configured semester date ranges. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/summary` | Admin, Librarian | Aggregate visits, unique visitors, current presence, peak hour, and average duration. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/analytics` | Admin, Librarian | Hourly, daily, and weekday/hour peak-utilization data using exact check-in timestamps. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/logs` | Admin, Librarian | Paginated attendance logs filtered daily, weekly, monthly, or by academic term. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/report.pdf` | Admin, Librarian | Stream a branded PDF using the same active filters as the dashboard. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/capacity` | Admin, Librarian | Read live occupancy, configured capacity, available spaces, and over-capacity state. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/capacity` | Admin, Librarian | Update maximum occupancy with a required audit reason. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/scan/resolve` | Admin, Librarian | Validate a permanent QR and return safe identity/current-presence information. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/scan/check-in` | Admin, Librarian | Atomically enforce capacity, record exact entry/purpose, and return a role-specific confirmation. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/attendance/scan/check-out` | Admin, Librarian | Close the visitor's current open attendance record. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/attendance/pass` | Student, Faculty, Admin, Librarian | Return the authenticated user's pass metadata, summary, and history without exposing the raw credential. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/attendance/pass.png` | Student, Faculty, Admin, Librarian | Render the permanent QR PNG; `?download=1` returns a downloadable filename. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users/summary` | Admin, Librarian | Count active Student, Faculty, and staff accounts. |

| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users/active` | Admin, Librarian | Paginated read-only directory where `accounts.account_status = 'Active'`. |
### ISBN metadata lookup

`GET /api/v1/admin/books/isbn/:isbn` is restricted to Admin and Librarian JWTs. It validates ISBN-10/ISBN-13 checksums, searches the local `titles`/`authors` catalog first, then queries Google Books and Open Library through fixed server-side endpoints. The response supplies only `title`, `author`, `publisher`, and `publicationYear` for the bulk-entry autofill workflow. Catalog creation remains a separate explicit transaction, and cover, copies, category, call number, and shelf location are never populated by the lookup.

## Library floor plan (JWT)

| Method | Endpoint | Roles | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/floor-plan` | Admin, Librarian, Student, Faculty | Read only the published layout, live categories, managed shelf totals, and each shelf's column/row dimensions. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/books` | Admin, Librarian, Student, Faculty | Search physical book copies and return the call number plus exact shelf column/row used for location highlighting. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/locations` | Admin, Librarian, Student, Faculty | List current managed and category-default shelf labels for catalog entry. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/editor` | Admin | Read the private draft plus the current published layout. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/draft` | Admin | Save a validated draft using the current revision. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/publish` | Admin | Atomically publish a validated draft and create a version snapshot. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/versions` | Admin | List the latest 100 published versions. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/versions/:id/restore` | Admin | Restore older geometry as a new draft without reverting current item assignments. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/shelves` | Admin | Create a unique managed shelf for later placement. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/shelves/:id/grid` | Admin | Change a shelf to 1–12 columns and rows; shrinking is blocked when removed compartments are occupied. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/transfer` | Admin | Assign 1–100 active copies to a valid column/row on their authoritative category shelf. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/floor-plan/background` | Admin | Store a validated PNG, JPEG, or WebP floor image up to 2 MB. |

Draft saves and publication use optimistic concurrency. If another administrator saves first, the API returns `409 FLOOR_PLAN_CONFLICT`; the client must reload rather than silently overwrite the newer layout. Public book-location responses expose catalog and availability data only—never borrower or circulation-owner details.
