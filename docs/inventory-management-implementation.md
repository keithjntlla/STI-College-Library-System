# SmartLib Inventory Management Implementation

## Module boundary

Inventory is a feature module inside the existing Node.js and Express modular monolith. It does not own bibliographic records or circulation policy:

- `catalog` owns titles, authors, categories, research metadata, and creation of physical copies.
- `inventory` owns barcode verification, physical condition overrides, copy-register queries, and audit history.
- `circulation` and `reservations` remain authoritative for Borrowed and Reserved availability.
- `reports` owns reusable streaming CSV and PDF rendering. Inventory exposes secured aliases for physical-copy reports.

The React implementation lives in `apps/web/src/features/inventory`. The API implementation lives in `apps/api/src/modules/inventory`. Both clients use `/api/inventory`; no separate service, database, or duplicate application is introduced.

The Research and Thesis Inventory subsystem is an isolated ledger inside the same module. `research_inventory` does not reference `titles` or `physical_copies`; it represents individually accessioned, physically bound papers. It reuses only the shared circulation barcode lookup when checking for an open loan.

## Data mapping and lifecycle

```text
titles (shared catalog metadata)
  1
  |
  +--< physical_copies (one accession/barcode per physical asset)
           |
           +-- material_id -> legacy circulation compatibility
           +-- last_scanned_at -> latest verification shown in the UI
           +--< inventory_audit_events (append-only history)

borrow_transactions + reservations -> authoritative loan/reservation locks
```

| UI field | Database source |
|---|---|
| Item Title | `titles.title` |
| Accession Number | `physical_copies.accession_number` |
| Barcode | `physical_copies.barcode` |
| Shelf | `physical_copies.shelf_location` |
| Condition | `physical_copies.condition_status` |
| Availability | `physical_copies.availability_status` |
| Last Verified | `physical_copies.last_scanned_at` |

`material_id` is preserved as the compatibility bridge to existing borrow and reservation records. Inventory never changes or reassigns that identifier.

## API contracts

All endpoints require an authenticated System Administrator/Admin or Librarian. Validation errors use HTTP 422, missing barcodes use 404, and unauthorized roles use 403.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/inventory/summary` | Active catalog/copy, damaged, and lost totals |
| `GET` | `/api/inventory/copies` | Paginated physical-copy register |
| `POST` | `/api/inventory/scans` | Verify a barcode and append a `Verified` event |
| `PATCH` | `/api/inventory/copies/condition` | Audit `good`, `fair`, `for_repair`, `damaged`, or `lost` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/inventory/copies/availability` | Manually set an idle copy `available` or `unavailable` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/inventory/copies/:copyId` | Delete a never-used physical copy; history requires archive fallback |
| `POST` | `/api/inventory/copies/:copyId/archive` | Archive an idle physical copy with a required reason |
| `GET` | `/api/inventory/export.csv` | Stream physical-copy CSV |
| `GET` | `/api/inventory/export.pdf` | Stream branded physical-copy PDF |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/inventory/thesis/summary` | Independent thesis totals, damaged, and lost metrics |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/inventory/thesis` | Paginated physically bound thesis register |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/inventory/thesis/audit` | Audit a thesis condition with an open-loan lock |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/inventory/thesis/availability` | Manually toggle idle thesis availability |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/inventory/thesis/:researchInventoryId` | Delete a never-used bound paper; history requires archive fallback |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/inventory/thesis/:researchInventoryId/archive` | Archive an idle bound paper with a required reason |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/reports/thesis/csv` | Stream a thesis-only CSV |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/reports/thesis/pdf` | Stream a branded thesis-only PDF |
| `GET` | `/api/catalog/research-inventory` | Student-safe bound-paper search; returns only `available` rows |

Copy lists return `{ success, data, meta.pagination }`. `page` defaults to 1, `limit` defaults to 25, and the limit is capped at 100. Optional filters are `q`, `condition_state`, and `availability_status`.

Scanner body:

```json
{ "barcode": "BC-00042" }
```

Condition body:

```json
{ "barcode": "BC-00042", "condition_state": "damaged" }
```

The service locks the physical copy before mutation. Good, Fair, For Repair, and Damaged preserve the existing availability; only Lost forces `Unavailable`, synchronizes the compatibility material row, and releases unclaimed accession assignments. Manual availability changes reject active loans/reservations, and Lost cannot be made Available. Every transition records before/after values in `inventory_audit_events`.

## Desktop scanner workflow

`useDesktopScanner` listens for fast keyboard-wedge input terminated by Enter. It ignores standard typing inside inputs, textareas, selects, and editable elements unless an element explicitly opts into scanner capture. A valid scan calls the API without navigation, updates `last_scanned_at`, refreshes the affected register, and shows a confirmation message.

## Development preview mode

Preview mode exists only for local layout and navigation evaluation. It must never be enabled in production.

1. In `apps/api/.env`, set `INVENTORY_PREVIEW_ENABLED=true`.
2. Start Vite with `VITE_INVENTORY_MOCK_AUTH=true` in its environment.
3. Run `npm run dev` and open `/admin/inventory`.

The React context exposes this in-memory preview identity:

```json
{ "user_id": null, "username": "admin_authenticated", "role": "Admin", "school_id": "" }
```

The server registers the session bootstrap only when `NODE_ENV` is not production and the explicit server flag is enabled. It accepts only loopback requests from the configured web origin, regenerates the session, and issues a CSRF token. Normal JWT/session authorization remains active for every Inventory API endpoint.

## Visual and accessibility rules

The module uses only `#003399`, `#FFF200`, and `#FFFFFF`, including opacity variants. Good, Damaged, and Lost states use different labels, icons, borders, and fill treatments, so meaning does not rely on color alone. The table includes a complete empty state, keyboard-accessible actions, progress labels, alerts, and modal semantics.

## Migration and operation

Run all migrations in order:

```powershell
npm run db:migrate -w @sti-library/api
```

Migration `20260820_006_inventory_audit_events.sql` adds audit history. Migration `20260820_008_inventory_condition_availability_policy.sql` installs the five-state contract and Lost-only database enforcement. Neither migration rewrites title, copy, material, loan, or reservation identifiers. `/api/health` reports `DATABASE_MIGRATION_REQUIRED` until required structures are present.
